# Cerberus
Cerberus Guard Bot: a hardened, multi-agent shield for AI-to-AGI systems. Starts with 3 guardians in different coding styles, coordinated by a central hub. Any bypass spawns 3 new random guardians (exponential growth, capped at 27 before total shutdown). Ensures AGI safety first, blocks jailbreaks, injections &amp; bot attacks.
